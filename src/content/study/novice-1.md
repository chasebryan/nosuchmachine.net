## 1.1 A message and an unwanted reader

Write these words:

```text
MEET AT THE BRIDGE
```

Imagine that you want one friend to read them, but not the person carrying
the paper. Nothing about the sentence itself makes that possible. Anyone
who sees it and understands the words can learn where you intend to meet.

The problem is not that the message lacks meaning. It has exactly the meaning
you need. The problem is that the wrong person can obtain it.

For this example, call the person sending the message **the sender**, the
friend **the receiver**, and the person trying to learn what you are hiding
**the adversary**. These are roles. The sender need not be a human typing at
a keyboard, and an adversary need not look suspicious. For now, three people
and a sheet of paper are enough.

Tell me what the adversary can do. Can they only look at the paper? Can they
replace it? Can they ask you to send another message? Those are different
problems. We will begin with the first: the adversary can see a copy of
what you send.

That restriction is an **assumption**: something we take as given while
examining this particular problem. It is not a promise that a real carrier
will behave so politely.

**Definition 1.1 — Confidentiality.** Confidentiality concerns keeping
information from parties who are not authorized to learn it. A precise claim
must identify the information, the parties, and the circumstances it covers.

Here, the information is the meeting location. The intended receiver is
allowed to learn it; the carrier is not. We have not yet said how to achieve
that separation. We have only made the question specific enough to work on.

## 1.2 Changing the appearance

Try reversing the characters, including the spaces:

```text
MEET AT THE BRIDGE
EGDIRB EHT TA TEEM
```

A **character** is an individual symbol in our written message. Here, each
letter and each space occupies one position. To reverse the message, read
those positions from the last to the first.

The result looks less familiar. Your friend can recover the original by
reversing it again. So can the carrier, once the carrier knows the rule.

You have changed the appearance of the message without creating a difference
between what your friend can do and what the carrier can do. Both have the
same written material and the same method of recovery.

Now hide the reversal rule. Perhaps the carrier fails to notice it. That is a
possible event, but it is not the same claim as protection against someone
who understands your method. We must not improve the description of the
adversary halfway through the argument merely because our design needs a
less capable opponent.

Shannon's opening quotation asks us to examine a system with its method
already known to the opponent. It is an analytical assumption, not a claim
that every opponent actually knows every system. The value is that it
removes a convenient excuse: *perhaps no one will understand what we did*.

Return to the paper. Under that assumption, reversal gives the receiver no
advantage. This follows from the example's rules; no claim about every
possible cryptographic system is needed.

## 1.3 A rule and a key are different things

Imagine a cabinet with many possible lock settings. Knowing how its lock is
constructed is different from knowing which setting opens this cabinet.
That distinction suggests a better question for our message: can the
receiver possess something useful that the observer lacks?

In the shared-secret setting we will study first, that additional input is
a **key**: a value shared by the sender and receiver and intended to remain
unknown to the adversary. The method describes how to use a key; the selected
key determines a particular use of the method. Merely adding a key does not
make the method secure. It gives us something whose role we can examine.

The cabinet is an analogy, not a cryptographic argument. A physical lock can
be cut away; a copied digital value does not become a second metal key. Keep
the distinction between public mechanism and selected setting, and leave
the rest of the cabinet behind.

A message supplied to an encryption method is called **plaintext**. The
result is called **ciphertext**. **Encryption** computes that result;
**decryption** attempts to recover the original using the required
information. Plaintext need not be ordinary language. Later, it may be a
sequence of numbers representing a file.

These names describe roles in a construction. Calling an output
*ciphertext* is not evidence that the construction protects it.

There are two separate questions. Can the intended receiver recover the
message? What can the adversary learn? A method might answer the first
perfectly and fail the second completely. Our reversal experiment already
demonstrates that distinction.

## 1.4 Describe the operation before trusting the result

Suppose I give you this instruction:

> Reverse the message.

Does that mean reverse the letters inside each word, reverse the order of
the words, or reverse every character including spaces? We selected the last
meaning in §1.2, but the short instruction alone does not tell you that.

A **specification** states the required behavior precisely enough for the
purpose at hand. Here is one for our paper exercise:

> Treat the message as a finite sequence of characters. Copy its characters
> from last to first, preserving each character exactly. For an empty
> message, produce an empty message.

A **sequence** is an ordered collection: which item comes first, second,
and so on matters. **Finite** means it has a limited number of items.
**Empty** means it has none. An empty message and a message containing one
space are therefore different inputs.

The material you give an operation is its **input**. What it produces is its
**output**. An **implementation** is a concrete way of carrying out the
specified operation. You could implement this reversal with paper, cards,
or a computer program.

The specification says what must happen. An implementation may or may not
do it correctly. Giving both the same name does not establish agreement.

Try the input `AB C`. The specified output is `C BA`. Reversing the letters
inside each word, while leaving the words in place, returns `BA C`.
Reversing the order of the words returns `C AB`. The three results differ,
so this input separates the three readings the short instruction allowed.

## 1.5 What one successful example establishes

You reversed the meeting message twice and recovered the original. That is
one successful example. Now consider the stronger statement:

> Reversing any finite sequence twice restores that sequence.

The word *any* adds an obligation. We now owe an argument about all the
permitted sequences, not a report about the one on our desk.

Take an arbitrary sequence: any one you like, without selecting it for a
special property. On the first reversal, the first character becomes last,
the second becomes second-last, and so on. On the second reversal, each
character returns to the position it had before. No character changes and
none is removed. The empty sequence also returns unchanged, because both
operations have no characters to copy.

That reasoning does not depend on the letters in the meeting message or on
its length. It covers the specified operation on every finite sequence.
This is a **proof**: an argument establishing a stated conclusion from the
stated rules and assumptions.

Notice what the argument does not establish. It does not show that an
unknown computer program really performs this reversal. It does not show
that the carrier cannot recover the message. We proved a particular
property of a particular operation. Its scope does not expand because the
proof is convincing.

A **test** examines behavior on selected cases. Tests help us find mistakes
and collect evidence about implementations. In a finite, precisely defined
model, a correct examination of *every* case can also establish a universal
claim about that model. The distinction is not “machines versus reasoning.”
It is what was covered and what follows from that coverage.

If we tested ten messages, we covered ten messages. If we proved the statement
above, we covered every finite sequence under the definition. If we executed
a program, we also relied on the machinery that performed the execution.
Keep those subjects separate.

## 1.6 Hiding a message is not every kind of protection

Change the situation. The carrier can now replace your paper with another
one. Your friend receives:

```text
MEET AT THE TOWER
```

The new concern is whether the received message was altered. That is a
question of **integrity**. Another concern is whether the message came from
an accepted source. That is a question of **authenticity**. For our purposes,
we need to be able to distinguish an authorized message from the carrier's
substitute. These are goals to investigate, not properties our reversal
method possesses.

Neither question is answered merely by making a message unreadable to the
carrier. Even detecting changes would not force the carrier to deliver the
paper. Protection against reading, alteration, impersonation, and
non-delivery must not be silently bundled into one reassuring word.

There is a further limit. Suppose a check establishes that a message was
created by someone holding a particular secret key. That alone does not
establish which human held it. To make an identity claim, you would also need
an account of how the key is associated with that person and who else could
use it.

You do not need the mechanisms yet. You need to keep the questions distinct.
This is the first habit I want you to carry into the rest of the book:
when you hear that something is protected, ask what the protection is
supposed to prevent.

## 1.7 Work at the desk

Use invented messages throughout these exercises. No real password or
private information is needed.

**Exercise 1.1 — Follow the specified rule.** Reverse `AB C`, including its
space. Reverse the result. Then give an input for which reversing the letters
inside each word would differ from reversing the complete sequence.

**Exercise 1.2 — Distinguish the inputs.** Explain why an empty sequence,
one space, and the character `0` are three different inputs. What does our
reversal specification produce for each?

**Exercise 1.3 — Name the missing claim.** A designer says, “Every message I
tried came back correctly, so no outsider can read it.” Identify two steps
in the conclusion that the reported evidence does not establish.

**Exercise 1.4 — Change the opponent.** For the meeting message, describe
one concern when the carrier may only observe and one additional concern
when the carrier may replace the paper. Do not propose a mechanism yet.

**Exercise 1.5 — Defend the general statement.** Explain why reversing twice
restores a sequence containing repeated letters. Your explanation must not
rely on recognizing each letter as unique.

**Exercise 1.6 — Inspect the subject.** You have proved the mathematical
reversal property. A program named `reverse` fails on an empty input. Is your
proof contradicted? Explain what has and has not been established.

You can now separate a message from its appearance, a requirement from its
implementation, and a successful example from a general argument. Next we
need a way to describe the characters themselves. Begin with two marks.
