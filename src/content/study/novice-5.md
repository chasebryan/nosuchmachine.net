## 5.1 A complete beginning

Create `first.or` in `orange-study`, not inside `orange-source`. Save exactly
this plain text. The shaded box is source; the box's border is not.

**Listing 5.1 — `first.or`**

```orange
edition 2026;
module first_steps {
  spec answer() -> Word[8] {
    13
  }
}
```

This is a complete file, not a fragment requiring an invisible wrapper.
Its only result is thirteen. That is enough to examine the boundary between
what we intend, what we write and what the tool reads.

Return to your shell in `orange-source`. Confirm the working directory,
then ask the built tool to check the saved file:

```sh
./compiler/target/debug/orangec check ../first.or
```

`check` requests source validation. `../first.or` names the input file.
A successful check does not compute and print the result of `answer`;
evaluation is a separate command. It also does not infer that a function
named `answer` solves any problem you had in mind. [O1]

Before evaluating it, explain why thirteen fits in a byte. Chapter 2 already
gave you the required range. You should not need the machine to settle that
question.

```sh
./compiler/target/debug/orangec eval ../first.or
```

**Expected evaluation output:**

```text
first_steps::answer: Word[8] = 0x0d
```

Hexadecimal `0x0d` is thirteen. The display did not change the value into a
letter or an encrypted message. It chose a representation.

## 5.2 Read the first line

A **keyword** is a word assigned a particular grammatical role by a language.
`edition` is a keyword here. The declaration `edition 2026;` identifies the
language edition for the source. The semicolon ends that declaration.
It does not assert that the source was written in 2026, and it is not the
Rust toolchain version from Chapter 4. [O2]

A **declaration** introduces or states something in the program. This first
one states an edition. The next one introduces a module.

The whitespace between `edition` and `2026` separates them. You may indent
the following lines to make structure visible, but indentation does not
replace the semicolon or braces that the grammar requires.

If you write `edition2026`, you have not compressed the same declaration.
You have formed different text. Reading a program is not guessing which
English phrase its author probably intended.

## 5.3 The module is a named boundary

`module first_steps {` begins a **module** named `first_steps`. A module
organizes declarations under a name. The opening brace `{` begins its body;
the matching closing brace `}` ends it. The final brace in Listing 5.1
closes this module.

`first_steps` is an **identifier**: a name chosen according to the language's
naming rules. Use letters, digits and underscores as the introductory examples
do, beginning with a letter. Case matters: `answer` and `Answer` are different
identifiers in Orange. [O2]

Inside the module is a function named `answer`. The evaluator identifies it
as `first_steps::answer`. The double colon separates the module name from
the function name. This is a **qualified name**, a name that includes its
surrounding context rather than depending on a short name alone.

For our one-file example, the filename and module identifier have different
roles: the path locates the file; the module name identifies declarations
inside it. Later, Orange's rules for loading additional modules connect
module names to neighboring filenames. We are not using that facility yet.
Do not infer its complete rules from this first example. [O1]

## 5.4 A function is a rule with an interface

In mathematics, a **function** associates each permitted input with one
output. Its **domain** is the collection of permitted inputs. The specified
collection in which its outputs must lie is its **codomain**. We will use
functions to describe computations without first tying them to a machine.

For example, “add one to a whole number” associates zero with one, one with
two, and so on. Whether negative numbers are permitted depends on the stated
domain. The verbal rule alone need not settle every part of the interface.

An **interface** states how a function is used: what inputs it accepts and
what kind of output it provides. Orange makes these parts visible in the
function declaration.

In `spec answer() -> Word[8]`, `spec` introduces an executable specification
function in the implemented fragment used here. It does not mean the function
has been proved secure or even that it matches an external standard. [O1]

The name is `answer`. The parentheses contain its parameter list. A
**parameter** is a name standing for an input supplied when the function is
used. This list is empty, so `answer` takes no parameters.

The arrow `->` introduces the result type. A **type** describes the values
allowed in a role and helps determine which operations have meaning there.
`Word[8]` is Orange's eight-bit unsigned word type. Its 256 values have
unsigned representatives zero through 255. The brackets enclose the word
width; they are not a request to select the eighth item in a list. [O2, O3]

The next braces enclose the function's body. The literal `13` is its final
expression. A **literal** writes a value directly. An **expression** is
source that denotes a value or a computation of a value. Here, the expression
is just the literal itself.

The final expression supplies the result. Orange has no `return` keyword,
and there is no semicolon after `13`. A semicolon ends the edition
declaration; it does not end this expression. Do not add punctuation merely
because a different programming language uses it. The permitted grammar
belongs to Orange. [O2]

## 5.5 Use the rule you already understand

Save the following complete file as `masks.or` beside `first.or`.

**Listing 5.2 — `masks.or`**

```orange
edition 2026;
module masks {
  spec apply(x: Word[8], k: Word[8]) -> Word[8] {
    x ^ k
  }

  spec example() -> Word[8] {
    apply(0x0b, 0x06)
  }

  spec recovered() -> Word[8] {
    apply(apply(0x0b, 0x06), 0x06)
  }
}
```

`apply` accepts two parameters. Each colon associates a parameter name with
its type. The comma separates the parameters. Both `x` and `k` are byte-sized
words, and the declared result has the same type.

Within Orange source, `^` is bitwise XOR. It is not exponentiation. In
Chapter 2, `2³` meant a mathematical power. In Chapter 3, `⊕` denoted XOR in
mathematical discussion. The symbol used to write an operation depends on
the notation or language being read. [O3]

A **call** uses a function with supplied input values. In
`apply(0x0b, 0x06)`, those values are **arguments**. Parameters name the input
roles in the definition; arguments supply values for a particular use.
The first argument goes to `x`, and the second goes to `k`.

Read the function body with those values substituted. It asks for
`0x0b ^ 0x06`. In binary, that is the byte-sized form of the operation you
already performed on paper:

```text
00001011
00000110
-------- XOR
00001101
```

The line of dashes labels the paper calculation; it is not Orange source.
The numerical result is thirteen. The byte still has eight positions,
including its leading zeros.

`recovered` contains a call inside another call. The inner result supplies
the first argument of the outer call. Start inside:

```text
apply(0x0b, 0x06) = 0x0d
apply(0x0d, 0x06) = 0x0b
```

Those equations explain the calculation; they are not declarations to paste
into the source file. They instantiate Proposition 3.1 using one retained
mask, not a new proof of confidentiality.

Check and evaluate the complete file:

```sh
./compiler/target/debug/orangec check ../masks.or
./compiler/target/debug/orangec eval ../masks.or
```

**Expected evaluation output:**

```text
masks::example: Word[8] = 0x0d
masks::recovered: Word[8] = 0x0b
```

The baseline evaluator reports the root module's parameterless specifications
in declaration order. It does not choose arbitrary arguments for `apply`
and print a table of every possible call. The absence of such a line is not
an indication that `apply` was ignored: both reported functions call it. [O1]

## 5.6 Scope gives a name its meaning

The parameter `x` names an input inside `apply`. It does not create a
universal variable named `x` in every other function. **Scope** is the region
in which a declaration makes a name available.

You can rename `x` to `value` if you also rename its uses within that scope.
The intended operation remains the same. Rename only the parameter and leave
`x ^ k` in the body, however, and the body refers to a name no longer declared
there. A consistent renaming preserves a relationship; an incomplete renaming
breaks it.

Similarly, `example` is a name, not an instruction to produce an example.
`recovered` is a name, not a certificate of recovery. You could name a
function `secure` and give it a body that simply returns its input. Names
can communicate intent to readers, but the body supplies behavior.

Comments have a different purpose. In Orange, `//` begins a line comment;
the remainder of that line is commentary rather than an expression. For
example, this is a fragment showing where a comment could sit:

```text
// Keep the mask available for the second application.
```

The comment can explain a decision. It cannot make the program retain a mask
that its computation discards. A careful reader checks whether the source
does what its commentary says. [O2]

## 5.7 Make one deliberate error

Keep the working `first.or`. Make a separate copy named `too_large.or`, then
change its function body as shown below. Do not overwrite your correct
example merely to follow the exercise.

**Listing 5.3 — `too_large.or`, intentionally rejected**

```orange
edition 2026;
module too_large {
  spec answer() -> Word[8] {
    256
  }
}
```

The type requires a byte-sized value. The literal is 256, which cannot be
represented as a `Word[8]` literal. Checking this file should reject it; a
successful evaluation output is not expected. [O2]

```sh
./compiler/target/debug/orangec check ../too_large.or
echo "$?"
```

Read the diagnostic, including the named file and indicated source location.
The exact line and column depend on the saved file, so compare the reason
for rejection rather than copying an unrelated screenshot's coordinates.
The program was not rejected because Orange dislikes large numbers. Its
literal conflicts with the type required at that position.

You may wonder whether 256 ought to become zero in an eight-bit word. That
is a question about the difference between constructing a literal and
performing a specified arithmetic operation. Keep it. Chapter 6 answers it
without changing this literal rule.

## 5.8 A successful check does not choose your intention

Change the working example's body from `13` to `12`, save, then check and
evaluate. Twelve fits the type just as thirteen does. The file can therefore
be well-formed and type-correct while failing your unstated requirement to
produce thirteen.

The source checker cannot recover a requirement you never supplied to it.
You need a way to state an expected result and compare the observed result
with it. Later we will place explicit tests beside functions and examine
what those tests cover. For this first run, your paper derivation supplies
the expected result; the transcript supplies the observation.

A **syntax error** concerns whether text has an allowed grammatical form.
A **type error** concerns an inconsistency in the values or operations the
program declares. A **behavioral mistake** can remain after those checks:
the program means something precise, but not the thing you intended.
These are distinctions for diagnosis, not a promise that every compiler
will phrase every diagnostic under exactly those headings. [O1, O2]

## 5.9 Learn the structure, not the incantation

Close the listing and explain how you would rebuild it. You need an edition,
a module, a function name, its input and result types, and a body expressing
the operation. You now have a reason for each piece of source instead of a
string to memorize.

Turing's concluding sentence looked toward further work on intelligent
machines, not toward Orange. Here it marks a more modest threshold: you do
not yet know the whole language, but you have a complete program and specific
questions you can investigate. Progress no longer depends on pretending
that the rest of the subject is already familiar.

## 5.10 Work at the desk

**Exercise 5.1 — Explain the punctuation.** In Listing 5.1, identify the
roles of `;`, `()`, `->`, `[]`, and each pair of braces. Explain why the
parentheses are empty.

**Exercise 5.2 — Trace a call.** Trace `apply(0xa6, 0x3c)` using Listing 5.2.
Write the argument-to-parameter associations, the two binary strings, and
the result. Trace a second application of the same mask.

**Exercise 5.3 — Rename consistently.** Rewrite the definition of `apply`
using parameter names `value` and `mask`. Which occurrences must change?
Which punctuation and types do not change?

**Exercise 5.4 — Add a result.** Add a parameterless function named `zero`
that calls `apply` with the same permitted byte value in both argument
positions. Derive the expected result before running it.

**Exercise 5.5 — Separate failure kinds.** Consider three edits: remove a
closing brace; put `256` in the `Word[8]` literal body; replace `13` with
`12`. Explain why the first two should be rejected and why the third can
pass source checking while missing an intended result.

**Exercise 5.6 — Read the display.** Explain every field in
`masks::recovered: Word[8] = 0x0b`. Does that one line establish the result
for every permitted pair of arguments to `apply`?

**Exercise 5.7 — Distinguish text from execution.** A source comment says
“this function authenticates its input,” but its body only computes XOR.
What evidence does the comment contribute about actual authentication?
What would have to be specified before the claim could be examined?

**Exercise 5.8 — Inspect a supplied label.** Someone renames `answer` to
`proved_answer` without changing the body. State one thing that changes
and one thing that does not.

A type did more than reserve space. It rejected one literal and admitted
another. Now let it determine what happens at the end of its range.
