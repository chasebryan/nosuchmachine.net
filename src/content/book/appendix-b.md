description: "A summary of the project's decision register and the status of its controlling decisions."

The [decision register](https://github.com/chasebryan/orange/blob/94c2fda3b26c41a707272468dd59054695d882ed/docs/DECISIONS.md) is the authority. This ledger is a
snapshot of its statuses for readers who want the whole map at once. `directed`
means explicit owner direction with details still open; `accepted` means
ratified at an exact revision; `proposed` means a recommended answer awaiting
its gate; `investigate` means the alternatives need a reproducible comparison.

literals), and OEP-0004 (the standalone product form).
