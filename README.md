# No Such Machine

Chase Bryan’s independent work in mathematics and cryptography, centered on Orange.

**Production domain:** [nosuchmachine.net](https://nosuchmachine.net)

![Orange-focused homepage preview](docs/redesign-preview.jpg)

## Structure

- The homepage presents Orange as the sole main project, followed by a brief introduction to Chase. Navigation leads to Orange, the Orange Book, About, and GitHub.
- A restrained layout, readable type, and orange accents replace the project catalog and animated background. The homepage has no canvas visuals or motion controls.
- The complete Orange Book is hosted at `/book/`, with a table of contents, 24 chapter pages, chapter navigation, section links, and local full-text search. The reader follows the original manuscript's order, including its preface, appendices, manuscript map, and source disclosure.
- All 40 existing project pages remain available at `/projects/<slug>/`, with their purpose, implementation, maturity, limitations, repository, and documentation links.
- `src/data/catalog.json` owns the project content. The [repository inventory](docs/repository-inventory.json) and [review report](docs/portfolio-review.md) record the public-repository review and earlier curation decisions.
- `src/data/book.json` records the book's publication metadata and chapter order; `src/content/book/` contains the generated chapter Markdown. The full upstream manuscript is retained in `vendor/orange/THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md` and available to download at `/book/orange-book.md`.
- The sitemap includes the catalog and all hosted book pages. Executable scripts must remain external to comply with the existing Cloudflare content-security policy.

## Develop

```sh
# Node 22.23.3 (.nvmrc). engines.node is >=22.23.3 so the locked undici floor (>=22.19.0) is met.
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run check
npm run build
npm run verify
npm run preview
```

`verify` confirms that Orange is the only featured catalog project and the only project linked from the homepage, and that the homepage has no canvas visuals or motion controls. It checks every hosted book chapter, reading order, previous/next links, active chapter navigation, search-index coverage, and consistency with the vendored manuscript. It also checks all generated project routes and source references, sitemap entries, internal links and anchors, image/script assets, unique IDs, one main landmark and heading per page, and CSP-compatible script output. CI runs the type check, build, and this integration check.

## Update the Orange Book

The hosted edition is pinned to Orange Book v0.26, snapshot October 2, 2026, from Orange revision [`4394a66201ff59d73bdd1dea38637bf9b7f37421`](https://github.com/chasebryan/orange/commit/4394a66201ff59d73bdd1dea38637bf9b7f37421). Builds use the committed manuscript and chapters without fetching upstream content, so the book remains available independently of GitHub.

To import a newer edition from a local Orange checkout with a clean `docs/THE_ORANGE_BOOK.md`:

```sh
npm run sync:book -- --repo /path/to/orange
npm run check
npm run build
npm run verify
```

Review and commit the updated vendored manuscript, downloadable source, metadata, and chapter files together. The import records the source commit, preserves chapter URLs, and rewrites manuscript-relative links for the hosted reader. If a new edition changes the section structure, update the chapter map and descriptions in `scripts/sync-orange-book.mjs` and the pinned chapter count in `scripts/verify-build.mjs` as part of that edition review.

`npm run sync:book` regenerates chapters from the committed manuscript. `npm run sync:book -- --check` checks the generated metadata and chapters without writing files or accessing the network.

## Deploy

https://nosuchmachine.net is served by Cloudflare Pages Git integration on project `nosuchmachine-net`. The apex and www resolve to Cloudflare anycast addresses, and responses include `server: cloudflare` and `cf-ray`. There is no GitHub Actions deploy workflow. GitHub Pages is not enabled, and `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` and `public/CNAME` have been removed so Pages cannot claim the hostname.

The dashboard build command is `npm run build:pages`. That script syncs the book, typechecks, builds, and verifies, and it stops on the first failure (`&&`), so a book sync that cannot reach Orange never publishes `dist`. Build output is `dist`. Node is `22.23.3` from `.nvmrc`.

Production apex `https://nosuchmachine.net` is a **Cloudflare** zone. Historically it was published by Cloudflare Pages project `wuci-ji` from [`chasebryan/-wuci-ji`](https://github.com/chasebryan/-wuci-ji). This repository is now the source of truth for the public portfolio.

`bottle.nosuchmachine.net` remains a separate Cloudflare Worker in `-wuci-ji` — do not remove that subdomain.

### Cloudflare Pages

1. Workers & Pages → `nosuchmachine-net` → Settings → Builds: build command `npm run build:pages`, build output directory `dist`.
2. The Pages build image reads `.nvmrc` (same setting as `NODE_VERSION`). Confirm the build log uses Node `22.23.3`. The v3 image defaults to `22.16.0` when nothing pins Node, which is older than `engines`. If a log shows that default, set environment variable `NODE_VERSION` to `22.23.3` for Production and Preview.
3. Custom domains stay on `nosuchmachine-net`: `nosuchmachine.net` and `www.nosuchmachine.net`. Remove those hostnames from the old `wuci-ji` project if they are still attached.
4. Book rebuilds: Settings → Builds → Add deploy hook, branch `main`. Orange posts that URL; do not put the URL in this repo.
5. Keep Always Use HTTPS and HSTS on the zone. `bottle.nosuchmachine.net` is a separate Worker; do not change it.

GitHub Pages is retired for this site. Do not turn Pages back on for `nosuchmachine.net`.
